[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types
- **`feat`**: New feature or functionality
- **`fix`**: Bug fix
- **`docs`**: Documentation changes
- **`style`**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **`refactor`**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **`test`**: Adding or updating tests
- **`chore`**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.

### Commit Examples
```bash

# Fix commits
fix(auth): resolve token refresh issue on app launch
fix(booking): fix date selection validation bug
fix(ui): correct responsive layout on mobile devices

# Refactor commits
refactor(listing): extract listing card widget for reusability
refactor(api): standardize error handling across all providers

# Test commits
test(auth): add unit tests for login validation
test(booking): add integration test for complete booking flow

# Chore commits
chore(deps): update Flutter to version 3.19.0
chore(ci): configure automated testing pipeline
```
