# Development Workflow & Commands

## Dependency Management
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Update dependencies
flutter pub upgrade
```

## Code Quality & Analysis
```bash
# Static analysis
flutter analyze

# Format code
dart format .

# Combined quality check
flutter analyze && dart format . --set-exit-if-changed
```

## Code Generation
```bash
# Generate code (models, routes, etc.)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Watch mode for continuous generation
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Development Environment
```bash
# Run in development mode
flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart

# Or with flavor
flutter run --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart

# Run with specific device
flutter run -d <device_id> -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

## Staging Environment
```bash
# Run in staging mode
flutter run -t lib/main_staging.dart

# Or with flavor
flutter run --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/controllers/auth_controller_test.dart

# Run widget tests
flutter test test/widget/

# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

## Build Commands
```bash
# Development build
flutter build apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
flutter build ios --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart

# Staging build
flutter build apk --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart
flutter build ios --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart

# Production build
flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
flutter build ios --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart

# App Bundle for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
```

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Clear app data and reinstall
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run

# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# Doctor check
flutter doctor
```

## Environment Setup
- Use `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, `.env.prod` for environment variables
- Never commit `.env.*` files to version control
- Use `flutter_dotenv` package for loading environment variables
- Environment selection is handled by entry point files and `--flavor` flags
